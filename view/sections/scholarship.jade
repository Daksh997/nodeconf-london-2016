            h1 Scholarship

            p.
                We’re aware that not everyone who is passionate about Node.js may be in a position to pay for a conference ticket.
                <br><br>
                With this in mind, we're delighted to announce the NodeConf London scholarship, which makes available a number of tickets at no cost.
