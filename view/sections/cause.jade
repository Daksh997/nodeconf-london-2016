                All leftover revenue from Edge ticket sales is donated to a 
                charity that promotes education of the next generation of 
                engineers who will look after the web. For Edge London 2015, 
                we are supporting CodeClub.

                Code Club is a UK­wide network of free volunteer­led after­school 
                coding clubs for children aged 9­-11.

                It creates projects for volunteers to teach at school clubs or 
                at non­school venues such as libraries. The projects teach 
                children how to program by showing them how to make computer 
                games, animations and websites. Volunteers go to their local 
                club for an hour a week and teach one project a week.
