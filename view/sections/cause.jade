            p.large.
                Community is a key value at nearForm and we’re keeping that very much in focus for NodeConf London.
                <br><br>
                Proceeds from the event are being donated to three local groups that mean a lot to everyone involved: NodeGirls, NodeBots and NodeSchool London.

                What’s more, speakers can elect to donate their fee, thus generating even more cash for the causes.
